/**
 * @defgroup hd44780_pins Atmega to HD44780 physical wiring
 * @brief How to connect Atmega loaded with Pato to HD44780
 *
 * In order to minimize number of physical connections with the display
 * Pato uses 4-bit data interface. For exact specification of the interface
 * please refer to [HD44780 Data-sheet](http://tinyurl.com/qxfogu9).
 * 
 * In order to minimize amount of code required to communicate with display 
 * controller, pins are grouped in two groups: control pins and data pins.
 *
 * Each group must belong to same GPIO port. Control pins set consists of:
 *   * RS - Register Select
 *   * RW - Read/Write 
 *   * EN - Enable (aka clock)
 *   * RST - reset. This pin is connected to Vdd pin of the display and is used
 *           for supplying power to display controller and cold reset.
 *
 * Data pins are DB4 to DB7, when the latter one is used also as BUSY bit of 
 * the display. The BUSY bit is set to HIGH when display controller is busy
 * while performing a command.
 *
 * @{ 
 * @def HD44780_CTRL_PORT
 * Must be set to GPIO port name (e.g. PORTA). Specifies Control Port - GPIO
 * port containing all control pins. 
 *
 * @def HD44780_CTRL_DDR
 * Specifies Data Direction Register (DDR) for the Control Port. It is 
 * suitable for assembly 'in' and 'out' commands.
 * Derived from HD44780_CTRL_PORT. 
 *
 * @def HD44780_CTRL_OUT
 * Specifies Control Port Register number suitable for assembly
 * 'in' and 'out' commands.
 * Derived from HD44780_CTRL_PORT. 
 *
 * @def HD44780_CTRL_IN
 * Specifies Input Register number for Control Port. It is suitable for 
 * assembly 'in' and 'out' commands.
 * Derived from HD44780_CTRL_PORT. 
 *
 * @def HD44780_DATA_PORT
 * Must be set to GPIO port name (e.g. PORTC). Specifies Data Port - GPIO port
 * containing all data pins.
 *
 * @def HD44780_DATA_DDR
 * Specifies Data Direction Register (DDR) for the Data Port. It is 
 * suitable for assembly 'in' and 'out' commands.
 * Derived from HD44780_DATA_PORT. 
 *
 * @def HD44780_DATA_OUT
 * Specifies Data Port Register number suitable for assembly
 * 'in' and 'out' commands.
 * Derived from HD44780_DATA_PORT. 
 *
 * @def HD44780_DATA_IN
 * Specifies Input Register number for Data Port. It is suitable for 
 * assembly 'in' and 'out' commands.
 * Derived from HD44780_DATA_PORT. 
 *
 * @def HD44780_RS
 * Specifies pin in HD44780_CTRL_PORT that is connected to RS pin of HD44780.
 *
 * @def HD44780_RW
 * Specifies pin in HD44780_CTRL_PORT that is connected to RW pin of HD44780.
 *
 * @def HD44780_EN
 * Specifies pin in HD44780_CTRL_PORT that is connected to EN pin of HD44780.
 *
 * @def HD44780_RST
 * Specifies pin in HD44780_CTRL_PORT that is connected to Vdd pin of HD44780.
 * This pin is actually used to supply power to of HD44780's logic and for
 * cold resetting.
 *
 * @def HD44780_DB4
 * Specifies pin in HD44780_DATA_PORT that is connected to DB4 pin of HD44780.
 *
 * @def HD44780_DB5
 * Specifies pin in HD44780_DATA_PORT that is connected to DB5 pin of HD44780.
 *
 * @def HD44780_DB6
 * Specifies pin in HD44780_DATA_PORT that is connected to DB6 pin of HD44780.
 *
 * @def HD44780_DB7
 * Specifies pin in HD44780_DATA_PORT that is connected to DB7 pin of HD44780.
 *
 * @def HD44780_BUSY
 * Alias or identical to HD44780_DB7.
 *

/**
 * @defgroup hd44780_cmds Low level HD44780 interface 
 * @brief Internal low level HD44780 device driver
 *
 * Pato provides a small low-level library for controlling HD44780-based 
 * display. It can be used as a snad-alone module for other projects. 
 * It is imlemented in assembly with a goal to minimize flash memory usage 
 * and stack usage. 
 * 
 * The low-level library for HD44780 is very simple to use, but I recommend 
 * reading [HD44780 Data-sheet](http://tinyurl.com/qxfogu9) beforehand.
 * I will try to explain the basic library functinality by example below.
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 * #include "hd44780.h"
 *
 * void main() 
 * {
 *    int i;
 * 
 *    hd44780_reset(HD44780_CMD_FUNC_SET  |
 *                  HD44780_CMD_FUNC_2LINES);
 *
 *    hd44780_ir_write(HD44780_CMD_DISPLAY         |
 *                     HD44780_CMD_DISPLAY_ON      |
 *                     HD44780_CMD_DISPLAY_CURS_ON |
 *                     HD44780_CMD_DISPLAY_CURS_BLINK );
 *    hd44780_wait_busy();
 * 
 *    hd44780_ir_write(HD44780_CMD_EMS |
 *                     HD44780_CMD_EMS_INCR);
 *    hd44780_wait_busy();
 * 
 *    for(i=0; i< 10; i++) {
 *        hd44780_dr_write('A'+i);
 *        hd44780_wait_busy();
 *    }
 * }
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 * 
 * The first thing we do is reset the display. The hd44780_reset() function
 * is equvalent to a power-off power-on dequence followed by
 * hd44780_ir_write(HD44780_CMD_FUNC_SET...). This combination is required
 * for seamless switch to 4-bit mode from default 8-mode.
 *
 * Next, Display Control command is sent. It turns display and blinking cursor.
 * 
 * Next, Entry Mode Set command is sent. It turns cursor movement and defines
 * that cursor will move right automatically.
 *
 * Finally, we make a loop of 10 writes that will show 'ABCDEFGHIJ' on the
 * display.
 *
 * Note that every command except hd44780_reset() is followed by 
 * hd44780_wait_busy() call. This is because calling other HD44780 commands
 * while the controller is busy executing the current one will probably lead
 * to skipping of the commands. The reset does busy waiting internally so it 
 * does not require calling hd44780_wait_busy().
 * 
 * @{
 * @fn void hd44780_reset(uint8_t cmd)
 * @brief Cold reset display or shutdown
 *
 * This function will turn power off and then depending on its parameter
 * will trun power on or keep the display off. After power-on, it is supposed 
 * to make first communication with HD44780 and switch it to 4-bit mode. In 
 * order to accomplish this the cmd parameter must contain a valid Function
 * Control command. For example:
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 * hd44780_reset(HD44780_CMD_FUNC_SET|HD44780_CMD_FUNC_2LINES);
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 * Note that DL bit in the command is LOW, requiring 4-bit interface. The 
 * hd44780_reset() will essentially issue a call equivalent to 
 * `hd44780_ir_write(HD44780_CMD_FUNC_SET|HD44780_CMD_FUNC_2LINES)`
 * command, but the actual communication sequence and timing
 * is different from hd44780_ir_write() because 8-bit (default) 
 * to 4-bit data bus switch.
 * @param[in] cmd 
 * @parblock 
 * 0xff display will be shut-down. 
 *
 * Any value other than 0xff must be a valid Function Control command with DL
 * bit LOW (4-bit data bus).
 * @endparblock
 *
 * @fn void hd44780_ir_write(uint8_t cmd)
 * @brief Write to HD44780 Instruction Register
 *
 * Initiates command execution. Call to hd44780_wait_busy() is required to 
 * ensure that the command is completed.
 * @param[in] cmd 
 * @parblock 
 * Command byte as defined by HD44780 protocol. See "Instructions" section 
 * in the [HD44780 Data-sheet](http://tinyurl.com/qxfogu9).
 * @endparblock
 *
 * @fn uint8_t hd44780_wait_busy(void);
 * @brief Busy wait for PD7 to become LOW
 *
 * When HD44780's DB7 is HIGH, the display controller is busy. This function
 * polls state of the pin defined by #HD44780_BUSY macro waiting for LOW value.
 * @return Current Address Counter value
 *
 * @fn void hd44780_dr_write(uint8_t value)
 * @brief Write to HD44780 Data Register
 *
 * Writes a single byte value to Data Register. Call to hd44780_wait_busy() 
 * is required for to make ensure that the command is completed.
 * @param[in] value Single byte value to be written.
 *
 * @fn uint8_t hd44780_dr_read(void)
 * @brief Write to HD44780 Data Register
 *
 * Read a single byte value from Data register. Call to hd44780_wait_busy() 
 * is required for to make ensure that the command is completed.
 * @return Single byte value of Data Register.
