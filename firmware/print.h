/**
 * @brief Print buffer
 *
 * A buffer that holds all the information required for formatting text
 * that is displayed by the controlled HD44780. 
 * 
 * Without printf support, this buffer shall hold just a null terminated 
 * string to be copied to HD44780 memory.
 *
 * With printf support the buffer shall hold both pintf's format string and
 * its parameters in binary format ready to be consumed by the printf() 
 * function. 
 *
 * It is responsibility of Pato's user to construct a valid content in the 
 * buffer either using hd44780_print_put(), hd44780_print_set_addr(), 
 * hd44780_print_commit() functions or by using @ref PATO_CMD_PRINT_PUT,
 * @ref PATO_CMD_PRINT_SETADDR, @ref PATO_CMD_PRINT_COMMIT and other print 
 * APIs. It possible for the user to change only parts of buffer by changing
 * the current address.
 *
 * The current print address is an offset in the buffer that defines the next
 * byte to be filled by hd44780_print_put(). Normally the current address is
 * autoincremented after each byte written.
 *
